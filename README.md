# An-image-encryption-scheme-based-on-Lorenz-Hyperchaotic-System-and-RSA-algorithm
This research proposes a new image encryption scheme based on Lorenz hyperchaotic system and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm. Firstly, the initial values of the Lorenz hyperchaotic system are generated by RSA algorithm, and the keystream is produced iteratively. In order to change the position and gray value of the pixel, the image data are hidden by additive mode diffusion. Secondly, the diffusion image matrix is reshaped into a one-dimensional image matrix, which is confused without repetition to hide the image data again. Then, the finite field diffusion algorithm is executed to realize the third hiding of the image information. In order to diffuse the pixel information into the entire cipher image, the additive mode diffusion algorithm needs to be looped twice. Finally, the cipher image can be obtained. The experimental results prove that the image encryption scheme proposed in this research is effective, and has strong anti-attack and key sensitivity. Moreover, the security of this encryption scheme relies on the RSA algorithm, which has high security.
